Meaning ""to go away"" is recorded from c.1460. Trans. meaning ""to exercise a dog (or horse)"" is from 1470. Walk-up  ...in ref. to an apartment not accessible by elevator is attested from 1919 as an adj., 1925 as a noun. The surname Walker probably preserves the cloth-fulling sense."

O.E. had many poetic words for ""war"" (guð, heaðo, hild, wig, all common in personal names), but the usual one to translate L. bellum was gewin ""struggle, strife"" (related to win). Sp., Port., It. guerra are from the same source; Romanic peoples turned to Gmc. for a  ...word to avoid L. bellum because its form tended to merge with bello- ""beautiful."" The verb meaning ""to make war on"" is recorded from mid-12c. First record of war time is late 14c. Warpath (1775) is from N.Amer. Ind., as are war-whoop (1761), war-paint (1826), war-path (1775), and war-dance (1757). War crime first attested 1906. War chest is attested from 1901; now usually figurative.

Skt. vaste ""he puts on,"" vasanam ""garment;"" Avestan vah-; Gk. esthes ""clothing,"" hennymi ""to clothe,"" eima ""garment;"" L. vestire; Welsh gwisgo, Breton gwiska; O.E. wæstling ""sheet, blanket;"" Hittite washshush ""garments,"" washanzi ""they dress""). The Gmc. forms ""were homonyms of the vb. for 'prevent, ward off, protect' (Goth. warjan, O.E. werian, etc.), and this was prob. a factor in their early displacement in most of the Gmc. languages"" [Buck].  ...Shifted from a weak verb (past tense and pp. wered) to a strong one (past tense wore, p.p. worn) in 14c. on analogy of rhyming strong verbs such as bear and tear. Secondary sense of ""use up, gradually damage"" (c.1275) is from effect of continued use on clothes. To be the worse for wear is attested from 1782; wear and tear is first recorded 1666."

The O.E. past tense was eode, of uncertain origin but evidently once a different word (perhaps connected to Goth. iddja); it was replaced 1400s by went, formerly past tense of wenden ""to direct one's way"" (see wend). In northern England and Scotland, however, eode tended to be replaced by gaed, a construction based on go. In modern English, only be and go take  ...their past tenses from entirely different verbs. The word in its various forms and combinations takes up 45 columns of close print in the OED. The noun sense of ""a try or turn at something"" is from 1825; meaning ""something that goes, a success"" is from 1876. Verbal meaning ""say"" emerged 1960s in teen slang. Going to ""be about to"" is from late 15c. Go for broke is from 1951, Amer.Eng. colloquial; go down on ""perform oral sex on"" is from 1916.

O.Fris. gan, M.Du. gaen, Ger. gehen), from PIE *ghei-, perhaps connected to Skt. jihite ""goes away,"" Gk. kikhano ""I reach, meet with,"" but there is not general agreement on cognates. The O.E. past tense was eode, of uncertain origin but evidently once a different word (perhaps connected to Goth. iddja); it was replaced 1400s by went, formerly past tense of wenden ""to direct one's way"" (see wend). In northern England and Scotland, however, eode tended to be replaced by gaed, a construction based on go. In modern English, only be and go take  ...their past tenses from entirely different verbs. The word in its various forms and combinations takes up 45 columns of close print in the OED. The noun sense of ""a try or turn at something"" is from 1825; meaning ""something that goes, a success"" is from 1876. Verbal meaning ""say"" emerged 1960s in teen slang. Going to ""be about to"" is from late 15c. Go for broke is from 1951, Amer.Eng. colloquial; go down on ""perform oral sex on"" is from 1916. That goes without saying (1878) translates Fr. cela va sans dire. Phrase on the go ""in constant motion"" is from 1843; go-between is 1598; go-getter is 1910, Amer.Eng., but goer, with essentially the same meaning, is late 14c. Goner ""something dead or about to die"" is first recorded 1850."

The O.E. past tense was eode, of uncertain origin but evidently once a different word (perhaps connected to Goth. iddja); it was replaced 1400s by went, formerly past tense of wenden ""to direct one's way"" (see wend). In northern England and Scotland, however, eode tended to be replaced by gaed, a construction based on go. In modern English, only be and go take  ...their past tenses from entirely different verbs. The word in its various forms and combinations takes up 45 columns of close print in the OED. The noun sense of ""a try or turn at something"" is from 1825; meaning ""something that goes, a success"" is from 1876. Verbal meaning ""say"" emerged 1960s in teen slang. Going to ""be about to"" is from late 15c. Go for broke is from 1951, Amer.Eng. colloquial; go down on ""perform oral sex on"" is from 1916.

Hel (from P.Gmc. *khalija ""one who covers up or hides something""), in Norse mythology Loki's daughter, who rules over the evil dead in Niflheim, the lowest of all worlds (nifl ""mist""), a death aspect of the three-fold goddess. Transfer of a pagan concept and word to a Christian idiom, used in the K.J.V. for  ...O.T. Heb. Sheol, N.T. Gk. Hades, Gehenna. Used figuratively for ""any bad experience"" since at least 1374. As an expression of disgust, etc., first recorded 1678. Hell-bent is from 1835. Hell-raiser is from 1914 (to raise hell is from 1896); hellacious is 1930s college slang. Expression Hell in a handbasket is c.1941, perhaps a revision of earlier heaven in a handbasket (c.1913), with a sense of ""easy passage"" to whichever destination. Expression hell of a _____ is attested from 1776. Hell or high water is apparently a variation of between the devil and the deep blue sea. To wish someone would go to hell is in Shakespeare (1596). Snowball's chance in hell ""no chance"" is from 1931; till hell freezes over ""never"" is from 1919. To ride hell for leather is from 1889, originally with reference to riding on horseback.

O.Fris. helle, O.N. hel, Ger. Hölle, Goth. halja ""hell"") ""the underworld,"" lit. ""concealed place,"" from PIE *kel- ""to cover, conceal, save"" (see cell). The Eng. word may be in part from O.N. Hel (from P.Gmc. *khalija ""one who covers up or hides something""), in Norse mythology Loki's daughter, who rules over the evil dead in Niflheim, the lowest of all worlds (nifl ""mist""), a death aspect of the three-fold goddess. Transfer of a pagan concept and word to a Christian idiom, used in the K.J.V. for  ...O.T. Heb. Sheol, N.T. Gk. Hades, Gehenna. Used figuratively for ""any bad experience"" since at least 1374. As an expression of disgust, etc., first recorded 1678. Hell-bent is from 1835. Hell-raiser is from 1914 (to raise hell is from 1896); hellacious is 1930s college slang. Expression Hell in a handbasket is c.1941, perhaps a revision of earlier heaven in a handbasket (c.1913), with a sense of ""easy passage"" to whichever destination. Expression hell of a _____ is attested from 1776. Hell or high water is apparently a variation of between the devil and the deep blue sea. To wish someone would go to hell is in Shakespeare (1596). Snowball's chance in hell ""no chance"" is from 1931; till hell freezes over ""never"" is from 1919. To ride hell for leather is from 1889, originally with reference to riding on horseback. Hell on wheels is from 1843."

O.N. hora ""adulteress,"" Dan. hore, Swed. hora, Du. hoer, O.H.G. huora ""whore;"" in Goth. only in the masc. hors ""adulterer, fornicator,"" also as a verb, horinon ""commit adultery""), from PIE *qar-, a base that has produced words in other languages for ""lover"" (cf. L. carus ""dear;"" O.Ir. cara ""friend;"" O.Pers. kama ""desire;"" Skt. Kama, name of the Hindu god of love, kamah ""love, desire,"" the first element in Kama Sutra). Whore itself is perhaps a Gmc. euphemism for a word that has not survived. Some equivalent  ...words in other languages also derive from sources not originally pejorative, e.g. perhaps O.Fr. pute, perhaps lit. ""girl,"" fem. of V.L. *puttus (but perhaps rather from L. putidus ""stinking;"" see poontang). Welsh putain ""whore"" is from O.Fr., probably via M.E. Cf. also Bohemian nevestka, dim. of nevesta ""bride."" And Du. deern, Ger. dirne originally ""girl, lass, wench."" Among other languages, Gk. porne ""prostitute"" is related to pernemi ""sell,"" with an original notion, probably of a female slave sold for prostitution; L. meretrix is lit. ""one who earns wages"" (source of Ir. mertrech, O.E. miltestre ""whore, prostitute""). The vulgar Roman word was scortum, lit. ""skin, hide."" Another term was lupa, lit. ""she-wolf"" (preserved in Sp. loba, It. lupa, Fr. louve; see wolf). And of course there was prostituta, lit, ""placed in front,"" thus ""publicly exposed,"" from the fem. pp. of prostituere (see prostitute). Another O.N. term was skækja, which yielded Dan. skøge, Swed. sköka; probably from M.L.G. schoke, which is perhaps from schode ""foreskin of a horse's penis,"" perhaps with the sense of ""skin"" (cf. L. scortum) or perhaps via an intermediary sense of ""vagina."" Sp. ramera, Port. ramiera are from fem. form of ramero ""young bird of prey,"" lit. ""little branch,"" from ramo ""branch."" Breton gast is cognate with Welsh gast ""bitch,"" of uncertain origin. Cf. also strumpet, harlot. O.C.S. ljubodejica is from ljuby dejati ""fornicate,"" a compound from ljuby ""love"" + dejati ""put, perform."" Rus. bljad ""whore"" derives from O.C.S. bladinica, from bladu ""fornication."" Pol. nierzadnica is lit. ""disorderly woman."" Skt. vecya is a derivation of veca- ""house, dwelling,"" especially ""house of ill-repute, brothel."" Another term, pumccali, means lit. ""one who runs after men."" Avestan jahika is lit. ""woman,"" but only of evil creatures; another term is kunairi, from pejorative prefix ku- + nairi ""woman."" The wh- spelling became current 16c. A general term of abuse from at least 13c. Whore of Babylon is from Rev. xvii:1, 5, etc."

Some proposed PIE roots include *weip- ""to twist, turn, wrap,"" perhaps with sense of ""veiled person"" (see vibrate); or  *ghwibh-, a proposed root meaning ""shame,"" also ""pudenda,"" but the only examples of it are wife and Tocharian (a lost IE language of central Asia) kwipe, kip ""female pudenda."" The modern sense of ""female spouse"" began as a specialized sense in O.E.; the general sense of ""woman"" is preserved in midwife, old wives' tale, etc.  ...M.E. sense of ""mistress of a household"" survives in housewife; and later restricted sense of ""tradeswoman of humble rank"" in fishwife. Du. wijf now means, in slang, ""girl, babe,"" having softened somewhat from earlier sense of ""bitch."" Wife-swapping is attested from 1959."

O.S., O.Fris., Du. wind, O.N. vindr, O.H.G. wind, Ger. Wind, Goth. winds), from PIE *we-nt-o- ""blowing,"" from base *we- ""to blow"" (cf. Skt. va-, Gk. aemi-, Goth. waian, O.E. wawan, O.H.G. wajan, Ger. wehen, O.C.S. vejati ""to blow;"" Skt. vatah, Avestan vata-, Hittite huwantis, L. ventus, O.C.S. vetru, Lith. vejas ""wind;"" Lith. vetra ""tempest, storm;"" O.Ir. feth ""air;"" Welsh gwynt, Bret. gwent ""wind""). Normal pronunciation evolution made this word rhyme with kind and rind (Donne rhymes it with mind), but shifted to a short vowel 18c., probably  ...from influence of windy, where the short vowel is natural. A sad loss for poets, who now must rhyme it only with sinned and a handful of weak words. Symbolic of emptiness and vanity since c.1290.""I have forgot much, Cynara! gone with the wind."" [Ernest Dowson, 1896]To get wind of ""receive information about"" is recorded from 1809, perhaps from Fr. avoir le vent de. Wind-chill index is recorded from 1939. The verb meaning ""tire, put out of breath"" is attested from 1811"
